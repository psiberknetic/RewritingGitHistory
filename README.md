# Rewriting Git History

This repository is used in my Rewriting Git History to Supercharge Your Code Reviews talk. Feel free to peruse the branches and play with the code to practice rewriting Git history!

### You'll need to AutoSquash

Many of the examples i'll be demoning will be squashing commits together. In order to do that, the --autosquash parameter needs to be passed to the rebase command. Rather than doing this every time, I have set a global setting to always autosquash during rebases. If you'd like to do that too the command is

`git config --global rebase.autosquash true`

### Tech I'll be Using

During this demo I'll be using the following technology. You don't have to use these technologies, but they're currently my preferred tools
- PoshGit
- C#
- Beyond Compare
